# RestaurantManagementSystem
Restaurant Managament System made in Java.

The user is greeted with an interface that has a "Log in" step. The manager and the employees are logging in separately, since they have different duties.
The waiter can not only open up orders, type them in and close them but also clock in or clock out from their shift. On the other hand, the manager can modify the menu items, their ingredients, manage employee's info, manage the orders and receive reports on how many hours each employee worked.
